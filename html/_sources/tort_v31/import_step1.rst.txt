**STEP1:IMPORT DATA**
======================

Some helpful tips before importing data:
  

*  Please make sure that the folder to be imported contains only diffusion data. If you are not sure, please convert the dicoms to nifti using the mricron *dcm2nii* tool. This should convert diffusion files into nii with associated bvals and bvecs. If structural was present in the same folder, it would not have an associated bvals and bvecs file. 

* It is advisable to open your nii file and look at the data in any visualization software to make sure the data has the expected number of volumes. 

* Once you import the data, please make sure you check your data before processing to make sure the gradient information has been correctly recorded. The reliable way to check the gradient information is to check the line fields or the non symmetric heures color map (tool included). The import tool relies on information present in the header file and if it is incorrect it will be translated into your data and processing. So this checking, especially for new studies, is highly recommended.

* The new import tools is capable of reading direction information from the header. Although, if your data contains intermediate b values (for ex: 200, 500, 1000) then please provide a gradient text file that is scaled to the maximum bvalue.The gradient text file will have tab separated three columns, with the same number of rows as the total volumes in the data to be imported. The top row will have the number of rows in the text file listed.




Please remember, if you use this version, all the following steps in DIFFPREP and DRBUDDI should be

 performed with the executables from this version.



Please click on the following import options to go directly to the associated section:

* :ref:`doc-imp-role1`

* :ref:`doc-imp-role2`

* :ref:`doc-imp-role3`

* :ref:`doc-imp-role4`

* :ref:`doc-imp-role5` 



IMPORT BRUKER
---------------

The syntax is as shown in the last line of the screenshot. If you would like to rename the output folder, please give it a full path to output folder and a *_proc* will be added to this new name. If not provided, *_proc* will be added to the original input folder.

..  _doc-imp-role1:




IMPORT GE DICOM, PHILIPS DICOM, SIEMENS DICOM
---------------------------------------------

The dicom import for all three scanners (GE, Seiemens and Philips) are similar with the exact same option. 
Please note: The big delta and small delta information is measured at the scanner using an oscillopscope and needs to be provided when you have very high bvalues (>2000)


.. image:: C:\Users\Ami\Desktop\importGE_new.png


These tools can be called  and used from command line using the following syntaxes:

..  _doc-imp-role2:

IMPORT GE DICOM
---------------
Syntax: Please insert the path to your folder in the < >

..  _doc-imp-role3:

IMPORT SIEMENS DICOM
--------------------
If regular Seiemens dicom
Syntax: Please insert the path to your folder in the < >

.. image:: C:\Users\Ami\Desktop\importSei_new1.png

Syntax: Please insert the path to your folder in the < >

..  _doc-imp-role4:

IMPORT PHILIPS DICOM
--------------------

PHILIPS PARREC
--------------
Please note: the options available with other dicom formats are not available with PARREC.

..  _doc-imp-role5:

IMPORT NIFTI
------------

.. image:: C:\Users\Ami\Desktop\importNIFTI_new.png

Please note: when importing 4dnii file, in addition to input file, it is mandatory to provide the phase encoding direction.

Your images are now imported into TORTOISE format and a **_proc** folder will be created in the same directory (or specified path when running the import command) outside of the dicom folder. This **_proc** folder contains the following files: **.list**, **.nii**, **.bmtxt**.
The **list** file contains link to the bmtxt and nii file that is in the proc folder. Dicom images are now converted to NIFTI *nii*  file. Please note: This nii file does not have an associated bvals and bvecs file. Bmtxt file is the file generated from the dot product of the gradient direction and the associated bvalues. 








**CHECK YOUR IMPORT RESULTS**
-----------------------------

Check your import results using the following tools. The outputs from running the following executables will be in the _proc folder to be viewed using any visualization software that supports the viewing of RGB format files. You will find the following executable in the ./TORTOISE31/DIFFCALC31/bin folder:

* *Linear fitting* should be performed to output a DT.nii

       *Usage*:  EstimateTensorWLLS full_path_to_listfile full_path_to_mask_file (optional)   dti_bval_cutoff (optional. all volumes will be used)

* *Non symmetric heuristic maps*  You can check the non symm heuristic map to determine if the data has been imported correctly by checking the non symm directionally encoded color maps. 
         *Usage*:  ComputeDECMapNS full_path_to_tensor_image

* *Gyphs* Tensor glyphs can also be viewed to determine if the import is correct


*Usage*: ComputeGlyphMaps  full_path_to_tensor_NIFTI_file  axis     (optional) slice_number (optional) full_path_to_output (optional)
 Axis:  axial, sagittal or coronal.  Default axial.
 slice_number: default center slice

Gyphs can be useful in detecting if the data has been imported correctly. It is sometimes not sufficient to look at just the axial slice as the difference maybe more evident in the coronal and/or sagittal slices. Notice in the example below, the glyphs  in the axial slice appears correct in both imports but the difference is seen in the coronal and sagittal slices.


**Correct**

**Incorrect (example when flip x and flip y are flipped)**
