TORTOISE is comprised of the following tools:

*  **DIFFPREP [1]**- Distortion and motion correction module:  `Link text  Command Line`   and    `Link text GUI`
*  **DR-BUDDI [2]** - EPI distortion correction module, run after DIFFPREP processing and if 2 or 4 opposite phase encode direction data present
*  **DIFFCALC [3]**- Tensor fitting and post processing correction module

In its newest form, DIFFPREP and DR-BUDDI modules have been revived from TORTOISE 2.5.1 and repackaged. DIFFPREP is primarily used in importing raw images, performing motion+eddy and EPI distortion corrections, as well as  reorientation to a template space (if provided). Importantly,  DIFFPREP has now been re-designed to run fully in C++ and does not require an IDL  license or VM (yay!)-- it is even executable from the command line. 
Some of the new features incorporated into the new DIFFPREP (and few in common with DR-BUDDI are as follows):

* Batch capability for import and processing the data
* Raw images converted to NIFTI format
* No IDL license requirement
* Gibbs ringing artifact removal
* Data denoising
* Improved image-based EPI distortion algorithm
* A detailed log of import and processing procedures
